This plugin provides both real-time and on-demand scanning of Python files with Pylint from within PyCharm/IDEA.

Pylint is a Python source code analyzer which looks for programming errors,
helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code smells 
(as defined in Martin Fowler's Refactoring book).

## Installation steps
1. In the **Settings/Preferences** dialog (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>), click **Plugins**. The [Plugins page](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/plugins-settings.html) opens.
2. Click **Browse repositories**.
3. In the [Browse Repositories dialog](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/browse-repositories-dialog.html) that opens, right-click on the plugin named **Pylint** and select **Download and Install**.
4. Confirm your intention to download and install the selected plugin.
5. Click **Close**.
6. Click **OK** in the **Settings** dialog and restart PyCharm for the changes to take effect.

## Configuration

The only configuration needed is to set the path to Pylint executable, and only if is not already
inside the PATH environment variable.

To reach the Plugin configuration screen you can open **Settings/Preferences** dialog (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>), click **Other Settings**  and then **Pylint** or simply click the gear icon from the side bar of the Pylint tool window.

To change the path to your Pylint executable you can either type the path directly or use 
the Browse button to open a file selection dialog.

Once you changed the path you should press the Test button to check if the plugin is able to run
the executable.

### Real-time inspection disabled by default
The plugin real-time inspection is disabled by default as numerous users find running `mix credo` in the background has 
a negative impact on their system performance.  If you like to try enabling the annotation, you can turn it on:

1. Preferences > Editor > Inspections > Pylint
2. Check "Pylint real-time scan"

### Inspection severity

By default, Pylint message severity is set to Warning. It is possible to change the severity level
by going to **Settings/Preferences** dialog (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>) -> **Editor** -> **Inspections** -> **Pylint** -> **Severity**:

## FAQ
### How can I prevent the code inspection to run on a specific folder?

The easiest way to ignore a specific folder is to mark it as Excluded from PyCharm/IDEA:

1. Open PyCharm/IDEA Settings -> *your project* -> Project structure
2. Select the directory you want to exclude
3. Click the Excluded button (red folder icon)

More info [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-folders-within-a-content-root.html#mark).
